# FrasierNaiveBayes

## HRUMC Abstract
Naïve Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes' theorem that today is commonly applied to text-heavy datasets and can be used in tasks such as spam filtering in emails. In this talk, we discuss how Naïve Bayes works as a classification algorithm, detailing the underlying mechanics and probabilities. A demonstration of the algorithm will be provided using the transcript data from the popular 90’s sitcom Frasier, starring Kelsey Grammar, which followed the life of Frasier Crane, a psychiatrist and radio talk show host in Seattle, Washington.
